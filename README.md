# Running the Application

Ensure you have Note.js installed and your path variable set accordingly.

In the root project directory, run:
```npm install```

Once that is finished, go to /src/config, and copy config.example.js. Create a new file, config.js, in the same directory, and fill in your Microsoft Azure translate key where indicated. Make sure it is within string quotes.
#### Ensure you are using a Microsoft Azure Translate key.

Finally, back in the root directory, run:
```npm start```

Once the app is open in your browser, feel free to play around. As it emulates a mobile device, there are two "screens"--please treat them as you would two separate devices.

This app functions best in Google Chrome, so it's suggested you test it in there.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
