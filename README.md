# Running the Application

In the root project directory, run:
```npm install```

Once that is finished, go to /src/config, and copy config.example.js. Create a new file, config.js, and fill in your Microsoft Azure translate key where indicated.
#### Ensure you are using a Microsoft Azure translate key.

Finally, back in the root directory, run:
```npm start```

Once the app is open in your browser, feel free to play around. As it emulates a mobile device, there are two "screens"--please treat them as you would two separate devices.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
